Rock Paper Scissors in JavaScript
=======
This is my attempt at Rock Paper Scissors for the Odin Project. The page for this project can be found at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors. I ran into issues attempting to push this branch to the remote, so I'm just using this branch ("rpsMain") for the project now that I'm done.
